								Interview With Elizabeth</b></u></p>
								<p align="left"><font size="2">March 30th, 2003:&nbsp; 
								Elizabeth Tuazon, a.k.a. Tarzan</font></p>
								<p align="left"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
								Tarzan has played numerous instruments over the 
								course of her years, and these include the piano, 
								bass drum &quot;2,&quot; concert percussion, marching snare, 
								and her own voice in singing.&nbsp; She has been 
								playing the piano for twelve years to this date, 
								she played bass drum for one, snare drum for three 
								years, concert percussion for eight years, and has 
								been singing for six years.&nbsp; In her opinion, 
								the instrument that has the greatest influence in 
								her life so far has been the piano, as she has been 
								playing it the longest, and is trying out for all 
								her college auditions on. (Elizabeth is currently 
								attending Illinois Wesleyan University -ed)&nbsp; 
								Many a multitude of experiences have left a lasting 
								impression on her.&nbsp; &quot;Drumline,&quot; she says, &quot;has 
								made me a lot more vulgar.&quot;&nbsp; To say the least, 
								I&#39;m sure.&nbsp; Marching band throughout her experience 
								in it has given her a &quot;great and ever-growing respect&quot; 
								of Mr. Romano.&nbsp; As she has gotten to work closer 
								with him in recent years, she noted that she has 
								seen all the hard work and effort he puts into his 
								work, and holds him in the utmost respect for what 
								he has done and continues to do.&nbsp; Being a section 
								leader has given Tarzan the opportunity to convey 
								her opinions and thoughts much more easily, and 
								has expanded her responsibility greatly.&nbsp; &quot;You&#39;ve 
								got to have confidence in yourself if you&#39;re going 
								to accomplish anything, it&#39;s just common sense,&quot; 
								she conveyed.&nbsp; </font></p>
								<p align="left"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
								The drumline has established countless traditions 
								over the years, some out of common sense, others 
								out of enjoyment.&nbsp; One of the staples of the 
								Alan Barone regime has been not to say verbals.&nbsp; 
								&quot;I guess that&#39;s always been one of Alan&#39;s things, 
								not doing verbals,&quot; Tarzan pontificated.&nbsp; Another 
								tradition of the drumline is to participate in our 
								own separate warm-ups, simply because we do things 
								differently than the band.&nbsp; Also included are 
								Jeeves, and the &quot;rooster&quot; Dante.&nbsp; One other 
								tradition of warm-up setup, is &quot;V-ing it up,&quot; or 
								&quot;Arcing it up,&quot; placing our hats in front of our 
								warm-up arc.&nbsp; Naturally, what would experiences 
								be without stories?&nbsp; There are quite a few 
								of those as are with any occurrence in history.&nbsp; 
								Tarzan has discussed with me a few of these stories, 
								which I shall presently relate.&nbsp; At Lake Park, 
								the first competition of the season, right before 
								the gates onto the track, Kevin Durnbaugh laid his 
								hand upon one of the fence posts.&nbsp; When he 
								took off his hand, the fencepost top was no longer 
								there, it was on his hand.&nbsp; Ever since then 
								it has been celebrated as a victory for us over 
								Lake Park, because the fencepost is gone, we have 
								it.&nbsp; Durnbaugh was from thereon thought of 
								as the drumline &quot;good luck charm.&quot;&nbsp; Going off 
								subject here, I would just like to add an interesting 
								quote from Tarzan, &quot;Phil played tenors, we all wonder 
								what&#39;s going to happen next year, everyone.&quot; (Psychic 
								ability, perhaps? -ed)&nbsp; Interesting thought 
								to ponder, eh?&nbsp; Moving on, Tarzan&#39;s sophomore 
								year, right before state, she was playing very badly 
								and not in time.&nbsp; Kevin Durnbaugh hypothesized 
								that it was the bass drums causing her to screw 
								up.&nbsp; So, he switched with her, and, finding 
								they were indeed the problem, stayed there, much 
								to her surprise.&nbsp; They re-learned all their 
								drill a few weeks before state, which &quot;was scary,&quot; 
								as Tarzan put it, but in the end everything was 
								much cleaner.&nbsp; &quot;Though Tony can&#39;t march, he 
								was an inherently good bass drummer.&quot;&nbsp; And 
								surprisingly enough, Tarzan originally wanted to 
								be in the pit, because of her piano experience.&nbsp; 
								However, today she couldn&#39;t possibly see herself 
								there.&nbsp; </font></p>
								<p align="left"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
								Tarzan&#39;s band mother was Michelle Krichbaumpt.&nbsp; 
								She was &quot;generally a good mom,&quot; to Tarzan, though 
								being in Pit, Tarzan and her relative didn&#39;t interact 
								that much at rehearsal.&nbsp; Marching band, in 
								her opinion, is so physically hard in the beginning, 
								yet once it is mastered is so much fun.&nbsp; Tarzan&#39;s 
								child is Jim Coneybear, and she confesses that she 
								is a terrible mom, mainly because of Jim being Jim...&nbsp; 
								Michael Guptwa, in Tarzan&#39;s opinion was one of the 
								more vulgar drummers, and swore profusely in German.&nbsp; 
								There was a trio of obscene and vulgar visual-creators.&nbsp; 
								This trio included Kevin Durnbaugh, Scott Fawkes, 
								and Mike Guptwa.&nbsp; Kevin created the Heroin 
								and the blood of Christ visual, which I will cover 
								more extensively in a moment.&nbsp; Scott Fawkes 
								was famous for his abortion visual.&nbsp; Moving 
								back to the blood, One day Kevin had a cut on his 
								wrist, and Tarzan and him were joking about it, 
								somehow connecting it to Jesus.&nbsp; He took his 
								sticks and made a cross with the blood, held it 
								up, and yelled, &quot;The blood of Christ!&quot;&nbsp; So 
								it was born, &quot;Periodically,&quot; Tarzan says.&nbsp; 
								One of the other Durnbaugh incidents was the praying 
								mantis stick &quot;thing.&quot;&nbsp; There are so many other 
								experiences she has come to know, one of which that 
								&quot;made her season&quot; freshman year.&nbsp; Of course, 
								I could delve deeper into all four years of her 
								life in high school, but then she claimed that I 
								would own her soul...&nbsp; Godspeed.&nbsp;&nbsp;
